The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I wasn't quite sure how to work with UIKit. I stumbled around a bit before I could get the program working correctly. I also couldnt get the UIStepper 
working but thanks to the documentation, I was able to make it work. Sadly, this took about two hours, so I was unable to implement anything extra.

Basic Application - 2 hours
Design - 2 hours
Extra - 3 hours
